/*
 * The algorithm implemented in this module is loosely based on the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm for
 * finding intersection among line segments in `O((n+k) log n)`, whereas `n` is the number of line
 * segments and `k` is the number of intersections.
 * The underlying idea is to use a imaginary sweep line that moves over the x/y plane and testing
 * only the line segments for intersection that the sweepline currently crosses, instead of
 * testing all segment with each other, which would be `O(n^2)`.
 * It does so by generating a prioritized event queue for start and end events of the line segments
 * and working its way through the queue (i.e., sweeping).
 * More information can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm
 * In contrast to the original Bently-Ottmann algorithm, the implementation below does not use a tree
 * data structure to store the segments in order to simplify the implementation.
 * See also https://github.com/rowanwins/sweepline-intersections#algorithm-notes
